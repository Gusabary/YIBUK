## Something trivial

Given that the project name *e-book* is too straight forward, (Actually I don't think an online bookstore has to sell e-books. That means print ones are also available there. Anyway.) I got a name that is a little bit more interesting, *YIBUK*, which means *Youthful Imagination Brings U Knowledge*. Although the sentence looks a little farfetched and strange, it is after all better than *e-book*, maybe.

I created this repo at Feb. 27th, almost a month and 100 commits ago. From developing the project, I actually learned a lot and now I feel excited and delighted, indeed.

Well, welcome to raise an issue ~
